Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how Waddle Works ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares personal information when you use our Swoosh mobile application (the "App").

Information We Collect

When you create an account on our App, we collect your email address to facilitate the account creation process. Additionally, users have the option to provide additional personal information such as name, gender, phone number, PDGA number, etc., which is stored in their profile. Users may choose not to provide any personal information other than their email address.

How We Use Your Information

We collect personal information to enhance the user experience within the App. The information provided helps us better understand our users and allows us to tailor the App's features and content accordingly. For example, aggregated data may be used to generate graphs and diagrams showcasing user demographics or popular disc preferences.

Data Sharing

We do not disclose individual user data to third parties. However, aggregated and anonymized data may be shared publicly within the App, such as in graphs and diagrams illustrating user statistics.

Data Security

Your personal information is securely stored in a backend database using Firebase, which employs industry-standard security measures to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of data.

User Control

Users have the option to delete their account and associated data from our system at any time. This can be done through the App's settings or by contacting our support team.

Permissions

The App requires access to photos or the device's gallery to allow users to add images when adding discs to their inventory. Additionally, location services (GPS) are used when users mark lost or found discs on the map.

Age Restrictions

There are no age restrictions for using the App. However, it is intended for individuals interested in managing their disc golf inventory and reporting lost or found discs. The content and features of the App are not designed for or directed towards minors.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our data practices. We will notify users of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
